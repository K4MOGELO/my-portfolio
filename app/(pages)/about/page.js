        Having seen most tech dudes have some sort of web portfolio website, I
        decided to have one of my own but more of a creative sandbox. I showcase
        my skills, projects, and experiences, while also experimenting,
        innovating, and bringing my ideas to life. So far, this has helped
        improve my web development skills, so I want to add more intriguing
        additions. Stay tuned.
